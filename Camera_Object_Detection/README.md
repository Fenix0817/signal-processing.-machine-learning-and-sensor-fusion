I plan to add the code for commonly used approaches in deep learning detection(localization in image and classification) with camera

Two Stage Approach: RCNN families(Mask-RCNN, Fast-RCNN, Faster-RCNN)

One Stage Approach: YOLO families(YOLO v1, v2, v3), SSD, FPN

CornerNet(https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01244)
CornerNet-Lite(https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.08900)
