Algorithms introduced in the presentation for tracking filter: Bayesian filter principle, Kalman filter, extended Kalman filter, unscented Kalman, particle filter.

I plan to add rest of the presentation held for sharing the basic algorithm and models in tracking, sensor fusion

(In case anyone is interested in joining in, send email to chisyliu@hotmail.com)I also plan to add some demo codes to illustrate how KF, EKF, UKF and PF works in tracking, sensor fusion, especially with radar and lidar
